# Project Overview

This project explores how demographic, familial, and behavioral factors influence high school student academic performance. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, we analyzed predictors such as age, gender, parental education, study habits, extracurricular involvement, and absences to determine their impact on GPA.

The primary objective was to train and evaluate a **multinomial logistic regression model** to classify students into three GPA categories:  
- **Low GPA**: (< 2.5)  
- **Medium GPA**: (2.5 - 3.0)  
- **High GPA**: (> 3.0)  

Our analysis included feature selection, model validation, and cross-validation to improve predictive performance.

# Methods

### Dataset and Feature Engineering. 
- The dataset consists of high school student profiles, including demographic, academic, and extracurricular data.  
- We removed highly correlated variables using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis.  
- The final model included the following predictors:
  - **Behavioral factors**: Study time, absences, tutoring, and extracurricular activities.
  - **Demographic factors**: Age, gender, ethnicity, and parental education.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualized GPA distribution** across age groups, gender, and ethnicity.
- **Examined correlations** between study habits, parental involvement, and GPA.
- **Boxplots and scatterplots** were used to assess trends in study time and absenteeism.

### Multinomial Logistic Regression Model
- Implemented **multinomial logistic regression** to classify GPA into three categories.
- **Odds ratios** were calculated to interpret predictor significance.
- **Cross-validation** (10-fold and LOOCV) was used to validate model performance.
- Compared results using **Random Forest** variable importance analysis.

# Key Findings

1. **Demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity) had little effect on GPA**, suggesting that behavioral factors are stronger predictors of academic performance.
2. **Absences had a strong negative correlation with GPA**â€”students with frequent absences were significantly more likely to fall into the low GPA category.
3. **Study time and tutoring were positively associated with GPA**, with students who received tutoring being over 13 times more likely to achieve a high GPA.
4. **Extracurricular activities, sports, and music participation were linked to higher GPA**, with students in multiple activities performing better academically.
5. **Cross-validation showed high model accuracy (~87%)**, indicating that our model generalizes well.

# Conclusion

Our analysis highlights the importance of study habits, tutoring, and extracurricular involvement in predicting student success. Schools should:
- Implement structured academic support programs to help struggling students.
- Encourage active participation in extracurricular activities.
- Develop attendance incentive programs to reduce absenteeism.

Despite some limitations (such as dataset imbalance), this model provides valuable insights into academic performance predictors, helping educators and policymakers design data-driven interventions.
