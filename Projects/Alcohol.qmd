# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** to predict whether an individual is an **alcoholic or non-alcoholic** based on **vital health statistics**. The dataset, collected by the National Health Insurance Service in Korea, contains 26 predictor variables, including age, weight, hemoglobin levels, smoking status, and more. 

We implemented several classification models and feature selection techniques to improve predictive performance. Our best model, an **XGBoost classifier with Hmisc imputation**, achieved a Kaggle score of 0.7315, in the top 20 on the class leaderboard.

# Methods

### Dataset and Preprocessing
- Data sourced from the National Health Insurance Service in Korea.
- Features include demographic, behavioral, and biological markers.
- Applied **missing value imputation** due to ~7% missing values in most predictors.
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using ggplot2 in R.

### Missing Value Imputation
We tested three different **missing data imputation** techniques:  
- **MICE** (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations)  
- **Hmisc** (Harrell Miscellaneous) imputation  
- **Amelia imputation** (multiple imputation assuming normality)  

Final imputed dataset was selected based on **cross-validation accuracy**.

### Model Selection
We tested multiple models to find the best-performing classifier:  
- **Random Forest**: Kaggle Score of **0.7294**  
- **Logistic Regression**: Kaggle Score of **0.7236**  
- **XGBoost (Final Model)**: Kaggle Score of **0.7315** (Best Performing Model)  

We optimized the **XGBoost model** using:  
- Gradient boosting techniques  
- Feature importance scoring  
- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, max depth, and tree count)

# Key Findings

1. **Smoking status and hemoglobin levels were strong predictors of alcohol status.**  
2. **Absences had a significant correlation with alcohol consumption.**  
3. **Hmisc imputation improved predictive accuracy compared to MICE and Amelia.**  
4. **XGBoost outperformed all other models**, making it the most reliable for classification.  
5. **Gradient Boosting models provided better feature importance insights** than simpler regression-based models.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrated the potential of **machine learning in public health analytics**, particularly in predicting **alcohol consumption behavior based on physiological markers**. 

Future research could explore:  
- Additional predictors (e.g., mental health, dietary factors).  
- Refinement of feature selection methods to improve classification accuracy.  
- Deep learning approaches for better feature extraction.
