# Project Overview

This study examines the **effect of different music genres on heart rate**, focusing on **classical music, heavy metal, and a control group (no music)**. Additionally, we explore the role of **listening duration** (10 minutes vs. 20 minutes) in affecting heart rate changes.

# Research Questions

1. **Does the type of music (classical vs. heavy metal) significantly impact heart rate?**  
   - Based on previous research, classical music is expected to lower heart rate, while heavy metal is expected to increase it.  

2. **Does listening duration (10 vs. 20 minutes) amplify the effect on heart rate?**  
   - Prior studies suggest that longer exposure may enhance the physiological response to music.

# Methods

## **Study Design**
- **Two-Factor Blocked Experiment**:  
  - Factor 1: **Music Type** (*Classical, Heavy Metal, Control*)  
  - Factor 2: **Listening Duration** (*10 minutes vs. 20 minutes*)  
- **Blocking Variable:** Gender (to remove variability in resting heart rates).  
- **Response Variable:** Change in heart rate (bpm before vs. after treatment).  

## **Participants**
- **144 participants** from Bonne SantÃ© Island, evenly split by gender.  
- Randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups (music type Ã— duration).  

## **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Heart rate measured immediately before and after listening to assigned music.  
- Boxplots and scatterplots used for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Missing data imputed using appropriate statistical techniques.

# Results

## **Key Findings**
1. **Music type significantly affects heart rate** (p < 0.001).  
   - Heavy metal **increases** heart rate significantly compared to both control and classical.  
   - No significant difference between classical and control.  

2. **Listening duration has a small but significant effect** (p = 0.021).  
   - **20-minute listening sessions** produced **greater heart rate changes** than 10-minute sessions.  

3. **No significant interaction between music type and listening duration** (p = 0.18).  

## **Statistical Analysis**
- **ANOVA Results**:
  - Music Type: ***p < 0.001*** (Significant)  
  - Listening Duration: *p = 0.021* (Moderately significant)  
  - Gender: *p = 0.066* (Marginal significance)  
  - Interaction Term: *p = 0.179* (Not significant)  

- **Post-Hoc Tukey HSD Test** confirmed:
  - Significant difference between **heavy metal vs. classical (p < 0.001)**.  
  - No significant difference between **classical vs. control (p = 0.89)**.  

- **Diagnostic Plots** revealed **two outliers**, which were removed for final analysis.

# Discussion

1. **Heavy metal significantly increases heart rate**, while **classical music does not lower heart rate relative to the control**.  
2. **Longer listening durations** slightly **increase the heart rate effect** but do not change the **direction of the impact**.  
3. **Gender was a significant blocking factor**, confirming that male and female participants have **different baseline heart rates**.

### **Limitations**
- **Participants were not randomly selected**, limiting external validity.  
- **Limited to two music genres**; future studies should examine additional genres (pop, EDM, country, etc.).  
- **Sample size could be increased** to improve statistical power.  

### **Future Research**
- How do **different music genres** affect **other physiological factors** (e.g., blood pressure, mood)?  
- Can music influence **concentration and academic performance** while studying?  
- Is there a connection between **music preferences and mental health**?
