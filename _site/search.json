My background combines quantitative problem-solving with creative storytelling, allowing me to analyze complex data while communicating meaningful insights.\nI have experience in data analysis, regression modeling, machine learning, data visualization, and database management. My technical skills include R, Python, C++, SQL, Snowflake, Tableau, and MicroStrategy. Additionally, my background in creative writing, dance, and jazz drumming gives me a unique approach to problem-solving.\nOutside of school and work, I enjoy dancingâ€“after 15 years of competitive dance, I joined UCLAâ€™s Icarus Contemporary Dance Company, for which I currently serve as Finance Director (June 2023 - present), as well as choreograph and perform. I also enjoy playing the piano and drums, running, hiking, and exploring LA!"
