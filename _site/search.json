My name is Maeve Horan-Portelance, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UCLA, majoring in Statistics and Data Science with minors in Global Health and Film, Television, and Digital Media.\nI am interested in data analytics across multiple disciplines, including healthcare, business intelligence, and media analytics. My background combines quantitative problem-solving with creative storytelling, allowing me to analyze complex data while communicating meaningful insights.\nI have experience in data analysis, regression modeling, machine learning, data visualization, and database management. My technical skills include R, Python, C++, SQL, Snowflake, Tableau, and MicroStrategy. I have had several opportunitites to apply these skills in a professional setting, the most recent being my Decision Science internship at Travelers Insurance, where I played a key role in evaluating the efficiency of alternate quote campaigns used in a backend model during the sale of insurance. My work involved leveraging SQL, Excel, and R to analyze large-scale datasets and drive data-informed recommendations.\nOutside of school and work, I enjoy dancingâ€“after 15 years of competitive dance, I joined UCLAâ€™s Icarus Contemporary Dance Company, for which I currently serve as Finance Director (June 2023 - present), as well as choreograph and perform. I also enjoy playing the piano and drums, creative writing and screenwriting, running, hiking, and exploring LA!"
