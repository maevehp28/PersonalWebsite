Hi! My name is Maeve Horan-Portelance, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UCLA, majoring in Statistics and Data Science with minors in Global Health and Film, Television, and Digital Media.  

I am interested in data analytics across multiple disciplines, including healthcare, business intelligence, and media analytics. My background combines quantitative problem-solving with creative storytelling, allowing me to analyze complex data while communicating meaningful insights.

I have experience in data analysis, regression modeling, machine learning, data visualization, and database management. My technical skills include R, Python, C++, SQL, Snowflake, Tableau, and MicroStrategy. I have had several  opportunitites to apply these skills in a professional setting, the most recent being my Decision Science internship at Travelers Insurance, where I played a key role in evaluating the efficiency of alternate quote campaigns used in a backend model during the sale of insurance. My work involved leveraging SQL, Excel, and R to analyze large-scale datasets and drive data-informed recommendations.   

Outside of school and work, I enjoy dancing--after 15 years of competitive dance, I joined UCLA's Icarus Contemporary Dance Company, for which I currently serve as Finance Director (June 2023 - present), as well as choreograph and perform. I also enjoy playing the piano and drums, creative writing and screenwriting, running, hiking, and exploring LA!
